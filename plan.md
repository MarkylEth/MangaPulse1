## Header Integration and Admin Panel Development

### 1. Universal Header Implementation
- Add the existing header component from the main page to all existing pages in the application (login, register, profile, and any other pages)
- Ensure the header maintains full functionality across all pages including navigation links, user authentication status display, and responsive design
- Header should dynamically show different options based on user authentication state (logged in vs logged out)

### 2. Admin Panel Creation
- Create a dedicated admin panel accessible only to users with administrator privileges
- Admin panel should include user management capabilities (view users, manage user roles, etc.)
- Implement proper access control to restrict admin panel access to authorized administrators only
- Include basic administrative functions for managing the application

### 3. User Interface Design Enhancement
- Design and implement a complete user profile page with user information display and editing capabilities
- Create improved visual design for the login page with better styling and user experience
- Design and implement an enhanced registration page with improved visual appeal and form validation feedback
- Ensure all designs are consistent with the overall application theme and responsive across different devices

### 4. Authentication Flow Integration
- Ensure seamless integration between login, registration, and profile pages with the universal header
- Implement proper navigation flow between all pages while maintaining user session state

### 5. Design Consistency
- Apply consistent styling and design language across all pages (header, login, register, profile, admin panel)
- Ensure responsive design works properly on mobile and desktop devices for all new and modified pages
